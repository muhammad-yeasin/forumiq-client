# Example environment variables for ForumIQ (frontend)
# Copy this file to `.env` or `.env.local` and fill in the values.
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit secrets to git. Add .env to your .gitignore.

# Public API base URL (baked into the bundle at build time)
# Example: https://api-forumiq.muhammadyeasin.com/api/v1
# If you're building a Docker image you set this as a build-arg:
# docker build --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/api/v1 .
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=

# NextAuth settings
# NEXTAUTH_URL must match the public URL where your frontend is served
# Example: https://forumiq.muhammadyeasin.com
NEXTAUTH_URL=

# Secret used by NextAuth (use a long random string / hex)
# Keep this identical between deployments where session/cookie signing must be consistent.
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=

# Optional / helpful
# NODE_ENV=production

# Notes:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are embedded at build time. If you need to change API endpoints at container runtime,
#   consider implementing a small runtime config injection (e.g. write a public/runtime-config.js from env at container start)
#   or rebuild the image with the appropriate build-arg.
# - If your backend uses cookie-based auth, make sure the backend config (CORS, cookie SameSite, Secure flag) is
#   correct for your environment (HTTP vs HTTPS, domain, cross-site requests).
